# 3D Renderer


Testing 3D Rendering using OpenGL

## Implemented IMGUI to change dynamically the size, rotation and position of the current object on screen

## Ongoing implementation:
- Adding a way to dynamically change texture through the GUI
- With the scene gui being able to select a specific object and change its settings without affecting the others
- other shapes
- lightning
